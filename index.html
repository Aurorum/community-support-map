          The Community Support Map is a project that aims to provide a way
          <strong>to connect people</strong> so that we can all help each other

              Once again, the world is faced with an event of biblical
              proportions. The only way to combat it is through community
              spirit, where we all take responsibility for helping each other,
              particularly whilst everyone is confined to staying at home. It
              could be assisting an elderly neighbour with grocery shopping or
              helping a local vulnerable person seeking accommodation. In this
              new world, never again can we walk away from the suffering or the
              needy, and so people must create the tools that connect us.

        <h2>How does the map work?</h2>
        <p>
          Essentially, it allows people to search around their local area for
          people offering assistance. If you're able to provide food, medicine
          or accommodation, you should register this on the map! After being
          approved, other people searching the map for help will then be able to
          contact you.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's aimed to be user-friendly and accessible, with even colour
          contrasts being considered so that everyone can benefit.
